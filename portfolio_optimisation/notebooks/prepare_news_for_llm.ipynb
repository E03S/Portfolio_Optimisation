vaping rates affect marginalized populations including those who identify as LGBTQ people living with HIV/AIDS and individuals involved in the criminal justice system — whose smoking-related risks are two to four times higher than the general population Marginalized groups specifically LGBTQ people living with HIV/AIDS and individuals involved in the criminal justice system are vulnerable to health epidemics like the vaping crisis due to social conditions that enable such behaviors … these groups are also more likely to face discrimination which further complicates their access to quality health care professor Perry Halkitis dean at the Rutgers School of Public Health told Benzinga Public health campaigns must seek to address underlying smoking stressors and inequalities among these

released report SipSource highlighted trends for the wine industry When looking at the impact of cannabis legalization on wine sales the firm found no notable impact “ While there is no definitive data on the subject early indicators are the legalization of recreational cannabis in 10 states has had a minimal impact on the beverage alcohol category If recreational cannabis was a significant factor we would expect noticeable and differentiated declines across spirits wine and beer in these states – and that is not the case ” SipSource analyst Dale Stratton told Benzinga “ At this point cannabis data is really hard to come by For anyone to make definitive statements on the impact cannabis is having on alcohol sales and consumption is premature We don ’ t see anything in the data currently showing a significant impact on wine and spirits trends ” he added in a media call California extractor Sisu Extracts launched a wholesale flower and white-labeling department Sisu is acting

formulations Picture by Javier Hasse That didn ’ t take long Trade talks haven ’ t even started yet but stock futures took a hit early Tuesday apparently because optimism is already running out of steam The laundry list of issues includes concerns about the ability of the lead Chinese negotiator to make a deal reports that China isn ’ t ready to move on the really big issues and new U.S additions to a group of “ blacklisted ” Chinese companies We ’ ve noted all along that it wouldn ’ t make sense for investors to get too optimistic about the talks that start Thursday because past negotiations have fizzled out when it comes to the two countries agreeing on some of the major bottlenecks It looks like many investors are going into the negotiations—which start Thursday—with caution Bonds are up again early Tuesday after falling Monday and gold is also finding a bid Worries are starting to grow because higher U.S tariffs on 250 billion of Chinese goods are scheduled to take effect in mid-October if progress doesn ’ t get made While caution is never a bad thing it might also not be the best idea to throw away any hopes for a positive outcome even if it ’ s not a full agreement At this point even if we end up getting news that negotiations will continue after this week or that those new tariffs could get delayed it might be seen as a market-friendly development If you ’ re someone who trades daily that ’ s more of an issue Long-term investors probably would be better off not following every twist and turn and not getting too focused on how each move affects their portfolio Otherwise news looks a little thin this morning aside from some data more below The S P 500 Index SPX appears like it might drop below its 100-day moving average of 2928 early today possibly setting up a test of psychological support at 2900 The 200-day moving average of 2843 remains well below current levels Volatility is on the rise with the Cboe Volatility Index VIX back above 19 early Tuesday after falling below 18 recently No Signs of Inflation It ’ s still weeks until the Fed meets but today ’ s Producer Price Index PPI for September and Thursday ’ s Consumer Price Index CPI for the same month could offer potential hints about what the Fed might be discussing when it meets PPI surprised with a negative reading for September falling 0.3 Analysts had expected a 0.1 rise It ’ s just one month but any pullback in prices isn ’ t necessarily the best news as far as economic health is concerned Goods and services prices both fell in September and the core PPI which excludes food and energy costs was flat Some analysts are already arguing that the negative PPI might be another quiver in the doves ’ bow over at the Fed Though PPI and CPI could play a role in the Fed ’ s rate deliberations later this month we already saw that the Fed ’ s most closely-watched inflation indicator Personal Consumption Expenditure prices PCE barely budged last time out That along with last week ’ s fair but not too exciting September jobs report don ’ t seem to show much potential for any kind of major pick-up in inflation Weakness overseas the strong dollar and falling crude prices are other factors that might give the Fed a clear runway to cut rates One possible argument against that thesis is if tariffs start causing prices to rise for U.S producers It ’ s always possible some of the pain might get passed along That doesn ’ t seem to be the case yet judging from Tuesday ’ s report Markets didn ’ t really show much direction Monday maybe in part because there wasn ’ t a heck of a lot of news What ’ s interesting is how the SPX continued to play with what some analysts see as a key support area near the 50-day moving average which began Monday close to 2942 In a setback for any bullish investors the SPX closed just below that on Monday That along with the market ’ s inability to find more buyers following an early rally Monday could suggest that the risk-off tone persists amid concern surrounding the trade talks While one day isn ’ t a trend something worth noting is how both gold and bonds fell Monday With both trading near recent highs you might chalk this up to simple profit taking Or it might reflect hopes for trade talk progress However stocks didn ’ t seem to get much juice from this bond and gold pullback which means it might have been more of a technical move Which “ Trade Barometer ” Are You Watching Like much of the market shares of Apple Inc NASDAQ AAPL couldn ’ t hold on to most of their early Monday strength That said AAPL is getting really close to its all-time high posted more than a year ago With AAPL rallying into trade talks there ’ s some talk that AAPL might be seen among some investors as a proxy for progress on trade In the past stocks like Caterpillar Inc NYSE CAT and Boeing Co NYSE BA often played that role and might still be worth a watch Today BA shares look like they ’ re coming under pressure from a Wall Street Journal article talking about more possible delays getting the 737-MAX back into the air in Europe The other sector that ’ s sometimes been seen as a barometer for trade is semiconductors which lost a little ground Monday but played a part in Friday ’ s sharp market gains There ’ s not much in the way of earnings news this week aside from Delta Air Lines Inc NYSE DAL on Thursday The big names in banking are lined up for next week starting with a bunch on Tuesday morning Last quarter you might remember that the Financial sector set a solid tone not only with its results but with the positive things their executives said about consumer demand That ’ s why this time it ’ s arguably more important than ever to get a sense of what the banking leaders are thinking We ’ ve seen jobs growth and manufacturing slow recently so how is that affecting demand for loans and the credit card market Next week could give us a sense Overall however the earnings outlook seems a bit uninspiring as the season approaches The latest S P 500 earnings estimate from FactSet is for a loss of 4.1 from a year ago If earnings do end up in the red it would be the third-straight quarter that happened and the first negative earnings trifecta since 2015/2016 Most analysts do expect improvement next year though that ’ s against much easier comparisons See more on FactSet ’ s outlook below As the SPX continues to trade in its long-term range between roughly 2800 and 3000 retail investors overall seem to be pulling back from their stock exposure according to the Investor Movement Index® IMXSM released Monday It measured at 4.51 in September down slightly from its August score The IMX is TD Ameritrade ’ s proprietary behavior-based index aggregating Main Street investor positions and activity to measure what investors actually were doing and how they were positioned in the markets Stocks finished Q3 roughly where they started but getting there was a volatile ride Investors appeared to react by rotating holdings away from equities and toward fixed income in September the IMX showed Many investors sold some of their FAANG positions as the Technology sector suffered from ongoing tariff uncertainty surrounding the U.S and China See more on the latest IMX reading below TRADE BAROMETERS OUT OF SYNC It ’ s been said that by following the fortunes of multinational stocks like Apple AAPL-candlestick and Boeing BA-purple line you can get a sense of the market ’ s hopes on U.S./China trade relations This year-to-date chart however shows competing pictures for the two with BA spending much of the year under pressure from its 737-MAX issues even as AAPL scampers toward all-time highs The takeaway So-called “ barometers ” don ’ t always tell the full story Data Sources S P Dow Jones Indices Nasdaq Chart source The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade For illustrative purposes only Past performance does not guarantee future results Trade War Sentiment and the Dollar Some of the consumer sentiment reports are picking up peoples ’ worries about the trade situation Tariffs hitting popular consumer goods could also become an issue consumers have to grapple with in the near future The next measure of consumer sentiment comes this Friday with the University of Michigan ’ s preliminary October sentiment reading and we ’ ll maybe see then if this concern continues to show up on consumers ’ minds The interesting thing will be to monitor sentiment in coming months when it ’ s possible consumers might have to pay more for some of their favorite goods Meanwhile the stronger dollar means it ’ s probably harder for U.S businesses to keep their products competitive on the world market especially with tariffs in the picture The dollar index finished Monday near 99 close to the two-year highs it posted earlier this year Expected vs Actual Earnings Just because analysts have low expectations for Q3 earnings doesn ’ t mean things will turn out quite so bad On average over the past five years actual SPX earnings have exceeded estimated earnings by 4.9 according to FactSet and over that time more than 70 of SPX companies have reported actual earnings per share growth above the mean estimate The number and magnitude of positive earnings surprises resulted in the earnings growth rate typically increasing by an average of 3.7 percentage points from the end of Q3 through the end of the earnings season over the last five years If you apply that increase to the estimated earnings decline as of Sept 30 of 3.8 the actual earnings decline for Q3 would be just 0.1 when all is said and done As we ’ ve said before earnings are the main driver of the stock market over the long term and buy-and-hold investors may want to tune some of the noise from the trade war and other geopolitical events as earnings blips tend to smooth out over time Also as the FactSet data indicate even shorter term earnings results can end up beating expectations Selling Pressure That said if you ’ re a more active investor it can be difficult to ignore all the noise about the trade war especially given all the related market volatility So it might not be surprising to have seen some shifting from stocks to bonds among TD Ameritrade clients amid ongoing tariff uncertainty during September But even though the IMX showed TD Ameritrade clients were net sellers of equities in September— lightening their holdings of popular tech names including Apple Facebook Inc NASDAQ FB Alphabet Inc NASDAQ GOOG and Netflix Inc NASDAQ NFLX —they did find some popular names to buy during the month Those included Slack Technologies NYSE WORK Walt Disney Co NYSE DIS Roku Inc NASDAQ ROKU and AbbVie Inc NYSE ABBV Like the larger client population millennials with TD Ameritrade accounts also net bought WORK DIS and ROKU but they also chose a few names to net buy that the overall population didn ’ t such as Aurora Cannabis Inc NYSE ACB Square Inc NYSE SQ and Lyft Inc NASDAQ LYFT Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy and is for illustrative purposes only Be sure to understand all risks involved with each strategy including commission costs before attempting to place any trade Image Sourced from Pixabay Like a playoff baseball game with lots of twists and turns we ’ ll probably have to go inning-by-inning as news trickles out today on trade talks Whether the last at-bat is a strikeout or a solid base hit a home run seems unlikely could help determine whether this early rally in stock futures is justified It seems like a long time since Monday ’ s selloff when trade hopes dimmed Now the base coach appears to be waving runners on as expectations climb for some sort of progress Stocks are on track for their third-straight day of rallying All this backs up what we said here on Monday about the chance of something positive coming out of this week even if a full deal seems unlikely Back then we discussed how it doesn ’ t seem prudent to get too optimistic or pessimistic because a lot can still happen and it ’ s unlikely this week ’ s negotiations will be the ultimate word If the two countries can agree on some minor steps like a possible delay in the U.S tariff increase set for Oct 15 some news outlets say that ’ s a possible outcome maybe that would put the market in a better mood and perhaps help lower volatility levels On the other hand if things go south today—always a possibility—sentiment could head down faster than the Chicago Cubs ’ 2019 playoff hopes Positive comments yesterday from President Trump and confirmation he ’ d meet today with China ’ s vice premier are two reasons for optimism What ’ s really interesting is that for apparently the first time there are signs China might agree to some things beyond buying more U.S products China ’ s securities regulator announced on Friday a timetable for scrapping foreign ownership limits in futures securities and mutual fund companies Reuters reported That looks like a real example of solid progress in the talks If anything gets announced today it ’ s going to be important for that to be included Several Fed speakers are on the prowl today so that ’ s another thing to keep an eye on other than trade talks Also Michigan sentiment is due later this morning see more below Earnings season starts next week with six major banks set to report Commitment to Upside Still Seems Lacking The mood definitely improved Thursday especially in trade-sensitive sectors like Materials Industrials and Technology but with a sense that many people are holding back There ’ s plenty of muscle memory about how often markets climbed on positive trade tidings only to fall again on the next negative tweet That could help explain why despite the rally over the last two days the S P 500 Index SPX didn ’ t really push too hard toward recent highs It finished yesterday just on the green side of its 50-day moving average—now near 2935 To see where sentiment really improved it ’ s arguably better to look at the bond market After falling to near three-year lows down around 1.5 earlier this week the 10-year yield has stormed back to 1.71 by early today That ’ s below recent highs of around 1.9 but enough to have some analysts talking about a potential double-bottom for yields A “ double-bottom ” in technical terms can sometimes mean the lows are in though there ’ s no guarantee Also a double-bottom hasn ’ t been established yet on the daily charts There definitely aren ’ t any guarantees as long as the bond market stays hyper-focused on trade If the Chinese and Americans go back to their corners with no decision this week or if economic data start to flag those yields could turn lower again It ’ s arguably way too soon to use the words “ bottom ” and “ yields ” in the same sentence Still the move this week looks constructive Gold fell yesterday too perhaps on trade optimism One other possible reason bonds and gold got sold off yesterday could have been weekly jobless claims A few weeks ago we pointed out that many analysts are giving the weekly claims number each Thursday a bit more attention than they used to because this number could be a possible early sign of any softness in demand for workers Claims of 210,000 came in below the average Wall Street estimate of 218,000 Behind the Scenes Key Technology Downgrade Worth Monitoring One thing you might not want to lose in the shuffle as hopes build for some sort of temporary trade deal is a downgrade of Cisco Systems Inc NASDAQ CSCO by Goldman Sachs Group Inc NYSE GS yesterday There ’ s no need to go over all the analyst ’ s specific points which you can find in the online news coverage What really stood out is that the analyst based his downgrade in part on the chance of deteriorating enterprise spending If that ’ s actually the trend it could be a big deal in coming months not just for CSCO but for others in the sector too including semiconductor companies CSCO is seen as a barometer of the worldwide economy overall because it sells so many enterprise products that underpin the Technology industry like switches routers and wireless Yesterday ’ s GS note said spending on enterprise products has fallen recently It probably goes back to the tariff situation In a world where things are undefined companies often won ’ t spend on infrastructure Even if the trade situation is settled by spring that means two or three more quarterly earnings cycles where companies can ’ t discuss the infrastructure situation and risk getting further behind the eight-ball If companies can ’ t plan that hurts suppliers like CSCO All this puts more focus on CSCO ’ s earnings call—expected in mid-November Not many companies have a better sense of the worldwide picture so it might be interesting to hear what CSCO executives have to say about the economic slowdown in Europe and Asia and to see their guidance That ’ s probably a month away though In the meantime semiconductor companies reporting later this month might give an earlier look at the state of the Technology sector In other sector and company news shares of Bed Bath Beyond Inc NASDAQ BBBY shot up more than 20 yesterday after the company announced a new CEO That was quite the welcome FIGURE 1 DOUBLING DOWN ON 10-YEAR This six-month chart of the 10-year Treasury yield TNX has some market watchers suggesting the possibility of a “ double bottom ” From a technical perspective this week ’ s quick recovery from recent lows looks like it could signal a trend reversal but remember some analysts earlier this year thought the 10-year yield made a double-bottom above 2 That one didn ’ t hold and it looked more like the classic double bottom Data Source Cboe Global Markets Chart source The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade For illustrative purposes only Past performance does not guarantee future results Zero-Point-Zero That 's the state of the Consumer Price Index CPI in September Flat Zero The news was arguably even more negative earlier this week on the Producer Price Index PPI side where the headline number actually fell 0.3 in September On a positive note core CPI did rise 2.4 year-over-year which does presumably reflect at least some inflation in the economy While it might be nice to pay lower prices for gas and other items flat or falling inflation doesn ’ t paint the most glowing picture and it ’ s going to be interesting to see whether those weak inflation readings get reflected in today ’ s October consumer sentiment report from the University of Michigan The report due later this morning could get a closer look than usual due in part not just to weak inflation but also the soft manufacturing data last week slowing jobs growth and other signs of weakness like auto sales The housing market has improved lately so that ’ s one positive the report might pick up Last time out headline sentiment was 93.2 but analysts expect a drop to 89.9 for this one It was 100 as recently as May Big Bank Bonanza Next Week The focus on trade that ’ s had markets in an iron grip over the last week or two might finally get some competition when Tuesday arrives That ’ s when earnings season informally begins with Q3 results on the way from six of the most closely watched banks Citigroup Inc NYSE C JPMorgan Chase Co NYSE JPM Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo Co NYSE WFC all start things off Tuesday morning before the open so expect a lot of headlines and maybe some confusion and volatility that morning as investors try to make sense of all the numbers You might remember that during Q2 earnings season Financial sector results helped renew investor confidence in the U.S consumer The question heading into Q3 is whether banking executives still see the same kind of strength and if they think it can continue amid trade wars Brexit and signs of weakness in the U.S economy If you ’ re keeping score at home the emphasis with banks this time around might be less on the actual earnings results—which are expected to fall slightly from a year ago for the sector according to FactSet—but on how the executives frame last quarter and the coming months If you ’ re going to only have time to listen to a handful of earnings conference calls maybe consider the Financial ones because these executives have a 20,000-foot view of most aspects of business and consumer trends and moods Pump Down the Volume We talked a bit yesterday about how confusing all these headlines on the trade talks can be Well it looks like some people are just giving up and staying on the sidelines Market volume sank mid-week and Briefing.com said this might reflect that “ participants have no idea what side they should be on at the moment ” It ’ s not a bad idea necessarily to restrain from trading when the market is see-sawing this way When the major indices are down 1 on one day and up 1 the next day all due to headline noise it ’ s often a good idea to stop watching all the minute-by-minute clicks stop checking your portfolio gains and losses and remind yourself why you ’ ve invested in the first place October tends to be a volatile month and this one is living up to its reputation The Cboe Volatility Index flirted with 20 earlier this week from below 13 back in mid-summer Despite all the back-and-forth the S P 500 Index SPX just hasn ’ t moved much It ’ s up just 1.2 over the last year So we ’ ve had a lot of noise and bumps on a trip that took us basically nowhere despite what you might think if you were watching every tick Information from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy and is for illustrative purposes only Be sure to understand all risks involved with each strategy including commission costs before attempting to place any trade How do you follow up a massive rally like the one we saw Friday There doesn ’ t seem to be an answer early Monday as stocks have a weaker tone but remain above a key technical support area The level to consider watching is right around 2942 for the S P 500 Index SPX That ’ s the 50-day moving average and the SPX finished solidly above it on Friday However the futures market isn ’ t necessarily reading from the same playbook this morning a sign that maybe the rally doesn ’ t have strong legs It ’ s the last week before earnings season so geopolitics could still play a big role in shaping performance Talks with China start later this week but media reports over the weekend suggest there ’ s doubt about how much China ’ s willing to talk about some of the major issues beyond just buying more U.S soybeans and pork China is “ increasingly reluctant ” to commit to reforms of industrial policy or changes to government subsidies Bloomberg reported It ’ s going to be interesting to see if the two sides can make any progress and without the distraction of earnings until next week any trade headlines could continue jolting the market Asian markets were mixed early Monday but European shares rose and the bond market took a step back The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 1.53 before the opening bell and this is another marker to consider watching this week The benchmark yield is just a few basis points above 1.5 a level it hasn ’ t fallen below in more than a month Any pullback in yields might suggest more trepidation about the economy Consider watching the Technology sector today for signs of possible strength as both Apple Inc NASDAQ AAPL and Nvidia Corporation NASDAQ NVDA saw analysts raise their price targets The big earnings report to keep an eye on this week is Delta Air Lines Inc NYSE DAL on Thursday The company ’ s shares got hammered last week after DAL lowered Q3 guidance “ Jobs Machine ” Keeps Ticking Friday ’ s payrolls data continued to show that the U.S economy is a jobs machine The report also suggests that in a tough global neighborhood the U.S continues to be the healthiest place to be Yes the report missed on the top-line number but a three-month job creation average of 157,000 this late in the economic cycle is pretty impressive especially when you factor in the ultra-low unemployment rate which fell to 3.5 While manufacturing jobs didn ’ t gain in September that ’ s a pretty volatile sector Also retail lost 11,000 jobs mostly in clothing but that probably won ’ t surprise anyone who ’ s been paying attention Meanwhile health care and business and professional services saw strength and the transportation and storage sector had a 16,000-job gain That ’ s a huge number and it means we ’ re still shipping stuff across the country That conceivably reinforces the theory that consumers are healthy and probably can stay that way through a solid holiday season After the calendar turns all bets are off if there ’ s no deal by then with China If that ’ s the case we could face a day of reckoning “ Just Right ” Data Propels Friday Rally From the way the market reacted Friday it appears investors understood the message the data sent about the economic bed not being too hard or too soft Hopes that the slower job and wage growth might help push the Fed into making more rate cuts appeared to be a big rally driver The energetic rally made up a lot of the week ’ s earlier losses and perhaps more significantly pushed the S P 500 Index back above its 50-day moving average by a comfortable margin The moving average had been around 2942 entering Friday but the SPX cleared it with about 10 points to spare Closing that high above it could bode well for trading this week That said the SPX and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJI both suffered their third-consecutive losing weeks If you want to get picky about payrolls wage growth didn ’ t budge from August and the year-over-year wage rise dropped below 3 for the first time in months see more below That might partly reflect the composition of the new jobs added in September many of which were in government and health care not traditionally high-paying positions like construction and manufacturing On the plus side if wage growth starts to slow that ’ s potentially one more reason why it might be hard for the Fed to argue against more rate cuts Job growth itself is slowing and some analysts chalked it up to the trade war There may be an element of that though a full-employment economy like the one we ’ re in tends to see smaller monthly gains even when there ’ s no trade war When unemployment drops to 3.5 it can mean many companies have all the labor they need It ’ s not uncommon to see 200,000 a month job growth in the beginning of a recovery but it would be odd to continue seeing it go on and on forever At the same time it wouldn ’ t be prudent to use an expression made popular by a former U.S president to completely discount the possibility that global weakness and trade tensions might ultimately affect the U.S job market If manufacturing data continue to disappoint it might be time to start taking that into account Retail sales data due Oct 16 could be important to watch as a possible sign of whether slower wage growth might be eating into consumer demand We ’ ll also start hearing from Financial industry executives that week as earnings come in and they often have a good sense of the mood on Main Street The Cboe Volatility Index VIX is near 18 down from highs above 20 last week With earnings and trade talks ahead it wouldn ’ t be surprising to see more choppiness as the week advances Fed in Focus It wouldn ’ t really be fair to finish talking about last week and payrolls without mentioning the potential Fed reaction It ’ s still weeks until the Fed meets and as one Fed official pointed out in an interview Friday there ’ s a lot of data between now and then The futures market indicates 76 chances of a rate cut later this month Those odds look pretty high historically speaking Additionally odds of a second cut before the end of the year stand at approximately 40 Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to make brief remarks at 1 p.m ET today but it ’ s unclear if he ’ ll discuss anything too important On Friday he said the economy is in a good place in his comments at a Fed Listens event And he added it is our job to keep it there as long as possible He didn ’ t really discuss policy or the economy Rate cuts wouldn ’ t necessarily be a panacea for a market that hasn ’ t been able to make a new high since late July That takes us back to the range of 2800-3000 which seems to be the mantra for the SPX Without a trade deal it seems hard to believe the market could move much above that anytime soon rate cut or not which is why it wouldn ’ t be surprising not to see a lot of follow-through from Friday ’ s fiesta FOOT STILL ON THE BRAKE The stock market might have had its best day in a while Friday but investors still seem to be hovering over the brake pedal That ’ s evident in this three month chart of the U.S 10-year Treasury yield TNX-candlestick and gold futures GC-purple line Yields descended last week to their lowest level since early September as economic worries grew and gold stayed close to recent highs above 1,500 an ounce as the shiny metal continues to attract investors who fear things could turn south amid trade and other geopolitical tension Data Sources CME Group Cboe Global Markets Chart source The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade For illustrative purposes only Past performance does not guarantee future results One Possible Reason for Stagnant Wage Growth The surprising thing about September ’ s jobs report might be how wage growth didn ’ t pick up despite the unemployment rate falling to 50-year lows That ’ s where worries might start creeping in if the pattern continues Typically in a full-employment economy—which we ’ re arguably in—workers demand higher pay and employers give in because labor supplies are tight and there ’ s competition for workers That can sometimes mean higher labor costs getting passed along to consumers With inflation well under the Fed ’ s 2 goal that doesn ’ t appear to be happening It might be partly a function of more low-skilled workers jumping back into the job market after being absent from it for a while Their wage demands wouldn ’ t necessarily be so high The U6 unemployment rate which counts both unemployed and underemployed workers was 6.9 in September down from 7.2 in August That category might include some of those lower-skilled long-term unemployed workers who are now working again Credit Check Looking more closely at business health corporate credit appears to be holding up pretty well Some market watchers say credit is the vanguard for equities and if that ’ s the case this time it might be a good sign Falling 5-year and 2-year Treasury yields arguably speak to a relatively healthy credit environment for companies that want to borrow and that could be helping support the stock market despite the weak manufacturing and service sector numbers we saw last week Credit and the Consumer Speaking of credit later today investors are scheduled to see the latest reading on consumer credit from the Federal Reserve Consumer borrowing in August is expected to have increased by 13.3 billion according to a Briefing.com consensus The last reading we saw for July showed an increase of 23.3 billion as revolving credit such as credit cards grew at the fastest pace since November 2017 With the U.S consumer in focus the picture of consumer credit is important Although we ’ ve seen evidence of some headwinds in consumer spending sentiment and confidence data recently it seems that the consumer overall is still pretty healthy and that could be behind the rise in consumer borrowing Information

Communications Services “ Comms ” looks to be a steady hand in an uncertain environment as some of the biggest names in the sector prepare to open their Q3 books As with pretty much all things in the investment arena there are caveats and big “ ifs ” For comms one of them is consumer spending—with a dose of consumer sentiment mixed in Why Because some of the components of the Communications Services sector rely heavily on users to keep their wallets relatively wide open as former traditional telecom companies transform into communications juggernauts Coupled with a handful of former Consumer Discretionary and Technology components the Communications Services sector also could have a pulse on the economy overall To that end note in figure 1 below how closely the Comms sector has tracked the broader S P 500 Index SPX FIGURE 1 MATCHED SET Over the past quarter the Communications Services sector IXC candlestick has moved in relative lockstep with the S P 500 Index SPX purple line perhaps an indication of how closely aligned the sector is to consumer spending and sentiment and thus to the overall economy Data source S P Dow Jones Indices Chart source The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade For illustrative purposes only Past performance does not guarantee future results All Eyes on the Consumer The good news is that both consumer spending and sentiment have been high but they seem to be losing some of their oomph Consumer sentiment as tracked by the University of Michigan posted a small uptick throughout September but “ show s signs of erosion ” according to the most recent Surveys of Consumers report “ Despite the high levels of confidence consumers have also expressed rising levels of economic uncertainty ” Chief Economist Richard Curtin wrote “ Some of these concerns are rooted in partisanship some due to conditions in the global economy Brexit Iran Saudi Arabia China and some are tied to domestic economic policies “ These and other policy concerns have so far been held in check by positive finances although fewer consumers now anticipate higher wages or lower rates of unemployment in the year ahead ” Curtin added Another data point that seems to support this rising uncertainty is the recent Investor Movement Index® IMXSM TD Ameritrade ’ s proprietary behavior-based index which aggregates Main Street investor positions and activity to measure what investors actually were doing and how they were positioned in the markets According to September IMX data TD Ameritrade clients were net sellers of equities—including a couple big Comms names Facebook Inc NASDAQ FB and Netflix Inc NASDAQ NFLX —and were net buyers of bonds Streaming War Heats Up Also batting at the sector ’ s door is competition between components that 's been ebbing and flowing along with changing consumer wants and desires Netflix might offer an example of how consumers ’ willingness to quickly jump to other platforms could impact the fortunes of a popular service Long the leader of video-streaming products and a go-to favorite for cord cutters NFLX surprised Wall Street in Q2 with disappointing gains in memberships particularly among U.S users To be sure there were still gains—2.7 million new subscribers—but the slowdown was remarkable compared with 5.5 million the company reported in last year ’ s Q2 and notably below the 5.0 million the company had projected Many including NFLX Chief Executive Reed Hastings took that as a sign of the pain the so-called streaming wars is already inflicting as Walt Disney Co NYSE DIS and Apple Inc NASDAQ AAPL prepare to enter the market next month “ While we ’ ve been competing with many people in the last decade it ’ s a whole new world starting in November ” Hastings reportedly said at the recent Royal Television Society conference according to Barron ’ s “ It ’ ll be tough competition ” That struggle also comes at a time when creating content is getting pricier putting dents in earnings per share amid higher operating costs Where ’ s the 5G Many analysts said they will be listening for updates on the state of 5G mobile networks the next technological generation of connections that promise higher speeds and lower latency which is the lag time to vastly improve streaming experiences Verizon Communications Inc NYSE VZ Sprint Corp NYSE S AT T Inc NYSE T and T-Mobile US Inc NASDAQ TMUS have been rolling out 5G in selected areas in choice cities for most of this year with a ramp up this summer and fall Analysts said they 'll want to know how the implementation has been proceeding and what the expectations are going forward There appears to be a lot of investor interest in this next generation But you might not want to spend too much time thinking about the hype 5G has a ways to go before it dominates the planet Regulatory issues remain among the top potential headwinds as both the Federal Communications Commission FCC and a number of

lists In a letter addressing Congress ’ s concerns about radio frequency issues FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai noted last spring that his agency “ places a high priority on the safety of wireless services and devices and relies upon verified engineering and scientific data as we carry out our mission ” He added that the FCC has “ ongoing rulemaking related to this matter ” and has placed congressional staffers in testing facilities to “ ensure proper compliance with engineering standards ” Bottom line It could take years before full implementation is completed There ’ s also the question of cost to consumers Mobile networks testing 5G in certain neighborhoods in Chicago and Minneapolis for example are charging an extra 10 a month for the limited privilege And the costs of the phones themselves—yes most users will need to buy a new phone—run upwards of 1,000 each at this point Of course that could all change if and when 5G becomes more widespread The Antitrust Wild Card Speaking of regulatory pressures there ’ s apparently been no letup on Facebook which is facing antitrust investigations by a number of state attorneys general as well as potential probes from federal agencies—including the Justice Department the Federal Trade Commission and the House ’ s judiciary committee Reuters reported Those queries come amid a number of reports about whether FB is sloppy in protecting consumer data and whether it ’ s limiting consumer choices They also come as at least one top presidential hopeful steps up attacks on big tech with particular aim on FB And then there ’ s the growing worry that FB ’ s efforts at cryptocurrency through its Libra platform are not only being stalled but might be derailed France and Germany have already decided to block it from Europe and others are scrutinizing it On the positive side some analysts said they are mostly keen on FB ’ s Instagram growth and robust user engagement Q3 Earnings Expected Release Dates Like most sectors in the S P 500 Comms is expected to report year-over-year net profit margins decline but this sector looks to be more in line with the overall S P projections than some of the others according to FactSet On a year-over-year basis FactSet estimated that Comms would mark an 11.9 net profit increase—a touch below last year ’ s 12.7 rise Overall the S P is expected to see an 11.3 gain compared with last year ’ s 12.1 advance Going forward FactSet ’ s projections for communications services for fourth-quarter growth sit at 5.4 earnings amid a 9.3 jump in revenues which has stayed steadied the closer earnings approach That ’ s an indication that there ’ s little investor concern going into earnings Netflix is scheduled to announce earnings after the close on Wednesday Oct 16 AT T is expected to report its earnings before the market opens on Wednesday Oct 23 Verizon said it will release its earnings ahead of the open on Friday Oct 25 Facebook is expected to release its results after the close
